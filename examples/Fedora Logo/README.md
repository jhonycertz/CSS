# Fedora Logo in CSS3

I've been using Fedora Linux for a while,
today, right after installing Fedora 17,
I decided to celebrate making a replica of it's logo with CSS3.

This is dedicated to all the crew that
made possible the [FUDcon LATAM](http://fudconlatam.org/)
at Valencia city in Venezuela! Sorry that I couldn't be there guys,
I hope you can accept this as a reward for your incredible job!
