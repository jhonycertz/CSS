# Fedora Logo in CSS3

I've been using Fedora Linux for a while,
so today, right after installing the last
Fedora 17, I decided to celebrate making
it's logo with CSS3.

This is dedicated to all the crew that
made possible the FUDcon LATAM at Venezuela!
Sorry that I couldn't be there guys,
I hope you can accept this as a
reward for your incredible job!
